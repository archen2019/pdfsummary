an auditory processing and oral language remediation
programme produced increased brain activity in areas
that are usually activated in children who have no
difficulty in reading.

language activates areas in the left hemisphere, with
additional activation in the preforntal cortex of awake
infants.

Werker, J. F., Fennell, C., Corcoran, K. & Stager, C. Infants’
abilty to learn phonetically similar words: effects of age and
vocabulary size. Infancy 3, 1-30 (2002).

This study showed that 14-month-old infants could
not learn to pair phonetically similar words with
different objects, whereas 20-month-old infants
could. Vocabulary size was a predictive factor in the
younger infants.
